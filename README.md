The aim of this project was to:  

1.  Replicate previous findings that sequential errors predict quitting in an online learning environment.
2.  Investigate whether there are individual differences in the effect of sequential errors on quitting.
3.  Examine the stability of these individual differences across two educational practice domains (addition and subtraction).

With this project, we found large, reliable individual differences in the extent that children quit following sequential errors.  While some students perservere in the face of failure, some are highly sensitive and quit the learning process prematurely.
